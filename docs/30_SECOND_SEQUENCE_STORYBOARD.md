# 30-Second Sequence Storyboard
**ILI-87** | Docker Build → Deploy Animation

## Overview
Code transforms into running container through Build (0-10s), Image Load (10-20s), Seal & Run (20-30s).

**Style:** Wireframe aesthetic, pulsing edges, glass materials, cinematic camera movements

## Phase 1: Build Phase (0-10 seconds)

**0:00-0:02 Opening** | Camera: Wide 45°
- Files (JS/CSS/HTML) materialize, float, rotate on dotted grid

**0:02-0:04 Build Start** | Camera: Dolly in
- Wireframe box forms with pulsing blue edges, progress bar, files stream in

**0:04-0:07 Building** | Camera: 270° orbital
- Layers stack, terminal scrolls, particle effects

**0:07-0:10 Complete** | Camera: Front zoom out
- Wireframe solidifies, checkmarks appear, transforms to glowing package

## Phase 2: Image Load (10-20 seconds)

**0:10-0:12 Takeoff** | Camera: Side tracking
- Package lifts with motion trails, particle propulsion

**0:12-0:15 Transit** | Camera: Chase
- Flies through clouds, data streams parallel, accelerating

**0:15-0:18 Arrival** | Camera: Wide front
- Decelerates, docking bay glows, alignment beams guide

**0:18-0:20 Docked** | Camera: Close-up
- Clicks in, locks engage, green indicators flash

## Phase 3: Seal & Run (20-30 seconds)

**0:20-0:23 Walls Up** | Camera: Top-down descending
- Dotted walls rise, phase transparent→solid, package unpacks, shimmer

**0:23-0:25 Extract** | Camera: Side cutaway
- Double-wall visible, content extracts/expands, progress bar, layers organize

**0:25-0:27 Seal** | Camera: Front zoom in
- Doors slide closed, bolts engage (metallic sound), isolation indicator

**0:27-0:30 Running** | Camera: Stabilized front
- Green pulse, activity indicators, subtle idle, fade to logo

## Camera Strategy
Smooth, purposeful movements. Each angle reveals new info. Dynamic but oriented.

Build: Wide 45° → Dolly in → 270° orbit → Front zoom out
Load: Side tracking → Chase → Wide approach → Close-up
Seal: Top-down → Side cutaway → Front zoom → Stabilized

## Timing

**Tempo:** 0-10s steady build, 10-20s fast/kinetic, 20-30s decelerate to stable

**Audio:** 0:02 build start, 0:10 launch whoosh, 0:18 dock clunk, 0:25 seal, 0:27 ready tone

## Technical Specs

**Colors:** Blue #0066CC (active), Green #00CC66 (complete), Orange #FF9933 (progress), Dark gray #1A1A1A (bg)
**Lines:** Dotted (forming), Dashed (progress), Solid (complete), Glowing (active)
**Animation:** Anticipation, follow-through, ease in/out, weight, staging
**Tools:** Figma (frames), After Effects (final), Blender (3D), Keynote (animatic)

## Dependencies & Next Steps

**Need from ILI-85:** Exact timing, transitions, brand colors, audio, target platform

**Questions for PM:** Duration fixed? Viewing context? Text/labels? Voice-over? Loop?

**Production:** Review with PM → Style frames → Choose tool → Animatic → Final build

**Recommended:** Figma for iteration, After Effects for final
