## Tips for Effective Use

### Be Specific with Page Names
```
‚ùå "Update the page"
‚úÖ "Update the 'Design System Roadmap' page in the Engineering workspace"
```

### Provide Clear Structure
```
‚ùå "Make a page about components"
‚úÖ "Create a page titled 'Component Library' with sections for Buttons, Inputs, and Layout components"
```

### Use Database Queries Efficiently
```
‚ùå "Show me my tasks"
‚úÖ "Query my 'Tasks' database for items where Status is 'In Progress' and sort by Priority"
```

### Leverage Block Types
```
"Use heading 2 for section titles, bullet points for lists, and toggle blocks for detailed information"
```

## Common Patterns

### Daily Standup Notes
```
Create today's standup page with:
- What I did yesterday (from completed tasks)
- What I'm doing today (from in-progress tasks)
- Blockers (from blocked status)
```

### Component Documentation
```
For each component in src/components:
1. Create a page in the "Component Docs" database
2. Add props table
3. Add usage examples
4. Link to Storybook
```

### Release Planning
```
Create a release page:
1. Query PRs merged since last release
2. List features and fixes
3. Add migration notes if needed
4. Create distribution checklist
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

### If pages aren't accessible:
- Make sure you've shared the page with your integration (‚ãØ ‚Üí Connections)
- Child pages inherit access, but siblings don't

### If updates aren't working:
- Verify your integration has "Update content" capability
- Check that the page isn't locked

### If searches return nothing:
- Integration only sees pages explicitly shared with it
- Use exact titles or search for page IDs

## Next Steps

1. Try basic page creation and reading
2. Set up databases for your workflow
3. Experiment with queries and filters
4. Build automation workflows
5. Integrate with other MCP servers
